package that holds some functions that I find useful and use semi-regularly. I have moved these functions into a package to facilitate cleaner coding. These functions are primarily designed for my use only. However, some published or soon-to-be-published manuscripts make use of code found in this repository. Thus, making public to facilitate open and transparent science.
